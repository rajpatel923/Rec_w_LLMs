# Movie Recommendation System with LLM and Traditional Algorithms Integration

This project is a movie recommendation system that integrates large language models (LLMs) with traditional algorithms, such as collaborative and content-based filtering, to provide contextually relevant, personalized recommendations. By combining the strengths of LLMs with conventional recommendation techniques, the system aims to deliver highly customizable suggestions based on user preferences and mood.
